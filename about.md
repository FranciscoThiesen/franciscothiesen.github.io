- Brazilian (living in Seattle)
- Computer scientist
- Compiler Engineer @ Microsoft CoreAI
    - Working on a Compiler for [MAIA](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-maia-for-the-era-of-ai-from-silicon-to-software-to-systems/)
        - Implemented a bunch of front-end and middle-end compiler optimizations. Still looking for more optimization opportunities.
    - Optimized triton kernels targeting inference for several LLMs
    - Made a few llvm upstream contributions, like [this one](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/3e746bd8fb6aece3c6d56dae4a9a7f0a7ec61859)
    - Currently exploring the autotuners space.
    
- Took part in several algorithmic competitions since age 13
    - Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics
    - ICPC (qualified for Latin-America finals 3x, best result 11th out of 700+)

    - Minimum Spanning Trees in Expected Linear Time [KKT Algorithm
    Implementation](https://github.com/FranciscoThiesen/karger-klein-tarjan)
    - Contribution to helion autotuner - [Added DE-Surrogate that led to 6% better optimal configs in less time than previous methods.](https://github.com/pytorch/helion/pull/1096)
    - [mirror_bridge](https://github.com/FranciscoThiesen/mirror_bridge) for generating Python/JS/Lua bindings for C++ code 

Some of my interests are (in no particular order):
- Algorithms
